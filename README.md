# ElevatorSystem

For the program to work properly, importing the javaFX library to your IDE is required. I suggest using IntelliJ IDEA for building and running this project.

You can pass two program arguments:
* the first one is number of elevators, it must be in the range from 1 to 16
* the second one is number of floors, it must be in the range from 1 to 18 

If you dont pass any arguments, number of elevators and number of floors will be set default.
